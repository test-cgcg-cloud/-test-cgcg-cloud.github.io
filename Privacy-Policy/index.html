<p>Effective Date: September 29, 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This FileScience Privacy Statement ("<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>") describes how FileScience and its affiliates (together, "<strong>FileScience</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>") collect and process information about you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate that you trust us when you provide us with your information. Protection of information is our top priority because we want to keep your trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We design all of our products and services with data protection in mind. We work hard to keep your information secure. We regularly monitor and update our security practices to help better protect your privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this Privacy Statement, (i) to "<strong><em>process</em></strong>" personal data means to perform any operation on the information, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organizing, storing, adapting, use, disclosure, combining, erasing or destroying and (ii) "<strong><em>personal data</em></strong>" means data that identifies, directly or indirectly, an individual natural person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Statement carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT, THEN PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO US OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> WHERE THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT APPLIES</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to our "<strong>Services</strong>", which means public portions of FileScience’s websites, including, but not limited to FileScience.io (<strong><u>https://www.filescience.io</u></strong>), FileScience Cloud-to-Cloud (<strong><u>https://cloud.filescience.io)</u></strong>, and registered users of these websites and our Core Products. If a particular product, website or service posts its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Statement -- applies when they are inconsistent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our right to process personal data also is described in our agreements ("<strong>Customer Agreements</strong>") with our business customers ("<strong>Customers</strong>"). In our Customer Agreements, FileScience is typically contractually prohibited from accessing the personal data that Customers store and otherwise process through FileScience’s Services. If a provision of a Customer Agreement conflicts or otherwise is inconsistent with a provision of this Privacy Statement, then the term of the Customer Agreement will prevail to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement does not apply to information that is collected by any third-party website or service that you access through the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> DATA CONTROLLER</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The data controller (i.e., the person who or entity that determines the purpose and means of processing) for the personal data collected pursuant to this Privacy Statement is Cyber Guardian Consulting Group, LLC. d/b/a FileScience, 63 John Street – Suite 3, Kingston, NY 12401.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that when we collect personal data pursuant to a Customer Agreement, we typically act as a data processor on behalf of our Customer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Use of the Services sometimes involves cross-border transfers of personal data.</p>
<p>For cross-border transfers of personal data, FileScience uses appropriate safeguards to require that your personal data be protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable data protection laws. These safeguards include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (Art. 46 GDPR) and other valid mechanisms for transfers of personal data among our affiliates and data processors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Effective Date of this Privacy Statement is set forth at the top of this webpage. As we add new features to the Services, differ our operations or are required by applicable laws, we may amend this Privacy Statement. If we make a material change to the Privacy Statement that reduces your privacy rights, we will notify you in advance through the Services. Your continued use of the Services after the Effective Date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Statement. The amended Privacy Statement supersedes all previous versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Personal data you choose to give us</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use the Services, we collect the personal data that you give us when using the Services. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an account is created, you provide us with a username and password, business or personal information, such as name, address, email address, phone number and other information that you choose to provide us.</li>
<li>When you make a purchase, you provide us with your order information and, if applicable, financial account information. (We do not collect payment card information - it is collected and processed by a third-party payment card processor.)</li>
<li>When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products, services or other initiatives, as well as other information which you may decide to give us.</li>
<li><em>When you fill out an on-line form to register to use our products and services, attend one of our webinars, marketing, training and other events or request information from us, we collect the information in the form and other information you may give us. This may include information such as first name, last name, place of work, job title, country, email, phone number, size of t-shirt, etc.</em></li>
<li>If you contact our customer service team, we collect the information you give us during the interactions. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and for quality assurance. If we are recording your interaction, we will provide a notice as required by applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personal data FileScience does not seek to collect</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FileScience does not need special categories of personal information (also known as "sensitive personal information or data"), as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to provide the Services. FileScience avoids collecting sensitive personal data from you through the Services or otherwise. Unless FileScience specifically requests it, please do not provide sensitive personal data to FileScience. If you choose to provide FileScience with unsolicited sensitive personal data, FileScience will process it only as necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. In the rare circumstances in which FileScience does seek to collect sensitive personal data, FileScience will do so in accordance with data protection laws and/or ask for your consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from others</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We receive information about you from others, including our vendors, service providers, resellers and other business partners. We also receive information about you from the third parties that help us operate the Services, such as for fraud detection, digital forensics, marketing services (such as when we acquire information on potential leads) and similar functions.</p>
<p><strong>Information collected when you use the Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use the Services, we collect information about which features you use and how you use them and information about the computer, tablet or mobile telephone ("<strong>Device</strong>") that you use to access the Services (collectively, "<strong>Usage Data</strong>"). Usage Data is personal data under certain privacy laws.</p>
<p>FileScience collects the following Usage Data:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Services usage information</em>: We collect information about which features you use and how you use them, including: date/time stamps associated with purchase, installation, updates and your usage; integrations; how often you use the Services and in which circumstances; Services performance metrics; features you use and the results of their operations; information about disabled features; and information about errors and crashes and activities which led to them.</li>
<li><em>Service operation information</em>: Depending on the Services you use, we collect information that is necessary to provide such Services and that forms an integral part of such Services. For example, we collect the list of software installed on your machine, together with version and manufacturer information as part of providing you vulnerability assessment and patch management functionality of certain Services. As another example, we collect information about names of potentially malicious files together with their hashes and full paths to such files or blocked website URLs as part of providing you antivirus and URL filtering functionality of certain Services.</li>
<li><em>Device information</em>: We collect information from and about the Device that you use to access the Services, including: hardware and software information Device or component ID, type and architecture, Device-specific and operating system settings, characteristics and configuration, device location, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your Device or browser; and information about your wireless or mobile network connection, like your internet vendor and signal strength.</li>
<li><em>Activity and audit logs</em>: An activity log is a list of user activities. FileScience’s servers automatically collect and store in logs your search queries, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, time zones, date and time of your request and referral URLs and certain cookies that identify your browser or FileScience account. Some logs include metadata which may contain your personal data like names of files and folders if you give them such names.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may link personal data and Usage Data or different types of Usage Data. We also may link personal data that we collect with publicly-available personal data, such as personal data available in public databases. If the linked information directly or indirectly identifies an individual natural person, we will treat it as personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Voice data</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not keep and process your voice data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FileScience Customer Experience Program</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FileScience collects certain information through the FileScience Customer Experience Program ("<strong>CEP</strong>").</p>
<p>Unless you consent to FileScience processing your personal data as part of CEP, FileScience will only collect pseudonymized Usage Data as part of CEP. FileScience gathers such pseudonymized Usage Data to improve FileScience products and services. FileScience achieves the pseudonymization by associating such data with a randomly generated number (pseudonym) instead of the personal ID associated with your FileScience account. FileScience cannot identify you by the pseudonym without you providing additional information to FileScience for identification purposes.</p>
<p>If you consent to FileScience processing your personal data as part of CEP, FileScience will connect your personal data to your CEP Usage Data. The personal data FileScience connects to your CEP Usage Data is limited to your FileScience account ID and account information. As in this case FileScience links personal data and Usage Data, FileScience treats the CEP Usage Data linked to your personal data as personal data. Your consent to FileScience processing your personal data as part of CEP allows FileScience to provide you more specific feedback and guidance about FileScience products, services, and features operation. You can consent to FileScience processing your personal data as part of CEP by checking the corresponding box in the product settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information collected through Data Collection Technology</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use cookies, pixel tags (also known as web beacons, flash cookies, and clear GIFs) and similar technology ("<strong>Data Collection Technology</strong>") to automatically collect information about you when you use the Services. Please read Section 6 below to learn more about how FileScience uses Data Collection Technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other information with your consent</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect other information when you give us permission at the time of collection for the purposes disclosed to you at that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> COOKIES AND OTHER DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGY</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer's hard drive. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the "lifetime" of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your computer, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using the Services.</p>
<p>Cookies set by FileScience are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by other parties are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable FileScience to provide third-party features or functionality on or through the website (such as interactive content and analytics). Third-party cookies recognize your browser when it visits the Services and also when it visits certain other websites and services.</p>
<p>Cookies also are typically categorized as "session" cookies or "persistent" cookies. Session cookies are erased when your web browser is closed. For example, a session cookie tracks how you navigate through the Services so that you do not need to re-enter the same information during the same visit to the Services. Persistent cookies store your preferences and other information for your current and future visits – they are still stored in your browser when you reopen your browser. For example, we may use persistent cookies to record your choice of language and country location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FileScience also uses other types of data collection technology, such as web beacons (also called a pixel tag or clear GIF). A web beacon is a piece of computer code that enables us to monitor user activity and website traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Data Collection Technology</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data collection technology helps us improve your experience of the Services by, for example, storing your website language preferences, so you do not have to select it each time you use the Services, compiling statistics about use of the Services, helping us analyze technical and navigational information about the Services, and detecting and preventing fraud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services use the following cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Strictly necessary cookies</em>, which are required for the operation of the Services, such as to enable you to register or log in to the Services.</li>
<li><em>Functionality cookies</em>, which are used to recognize you when you return to the Services.</li>
<li><em>Analytical/performance cookies</em>, which allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors to our website, to learn how users navigate the Services and to help us to improve how the Services function.</li>
<li>We also use Google Analytics, which is a Google service that aggregates information about use of the Services and reports website trends. Google Analytics does not directly identify individual users.</li>
<li><em>Advertising and targeting</em>&nbsp;cookies, which are used to deliver tailored information about our products and services that may be of interest or value to you and marketing and promotional emails (with your consent where required by applicable law).</li>
</ul>
<p>We use Google Analytics to better understand how our visitors and customers use our Services. Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"><strong>https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</strong></a>&nbsp;for more information about how Google uses the information it collects through our websites. For Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"><strong>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</strong></a>. Please see also Section 13 below.</p>
<p>Detailed description of the specific cookies used, including their purpose and expiration period can be found in FileScience’s&nbsp;<strong><u>Cookie notice</u></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Management</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can control and manage cookies using the&nbsp;<strong><u>Privacy Preference center</u></strong>, if FileScience makes it available in your region, or directly in your browser. Most browsers allow viewing, managing, deleting or blocking cookies. Please be aware that if you delete or block cookies directly in your browser then some of your preferences can be lost, as well as some functionality may no longer be available, including the ability to opt-out and mange cookies via the&nbsp;<strong><u>Privacy Preference center</u></strong>&nbsp;as this function itself uses cookie for keeping your preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may find the guidelines on how to control cookies for common browsers at the links below:</p>

<p><strong>Our Statement on Do Not Track Signals</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("<strong>DNT</strong>") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain personal data about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including FileScience, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>For California residents</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This California Privacy Rights Notice ("<strong>California Privacy Notice</strong>") explains privacy rights available to residents of the State of California as required by the&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=1.81.5.&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=&amp;article="><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018</strong></a>&nbsp;("<strong>CCPA</strong>").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this California Privacy Notice and any provision in the rest of our Privacy Statement conflict, then this California Privacy Notice controls for the processing of Personal Information of residents of the State of California. In CCPA, California residents are referred as "consumers" and we refer to them in this California Privacy Notice as "<strong>California Consumers</strong>" and "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California Consumer or household.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your California Consumer Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCPA offers California Consumers the following key privacy rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to request information about categories and specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you (see table below), as well as the categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected, the purpose for collecting Personal Information and the categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</li>
<li>You have the right to request information about our disclosure for business purposes of your Personal Information to third parties.</li>
<li>You have the right to request that we delete certain Personal Information that we have collected from you.</li>
<li>If we offer a financial incentive or price or service difference in exchange for your Personal Information, we will notify you in advance before collecting your Personal Information for this purpose and explain how you can opt into the financial incentive or price or service difference.</li>
<li>You have the right to opt out of our sale of your Personal Information if and when we determine the purpose and means of processing of your Personal Information. (In CCPA, "<strong>sale</strong>" means transferring or making available Personal Information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.) Sharing your Personal Information with our service providers is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a sale of your Personal Information because we make sure that our service providers are contractually obligated to use the Personal Information only to provide services to us and not to sell it.&nbsp;<strong><em>Note that&nbsp;FileScience does not sell (within the meaning of CCPA) your Personal Information to third parties and accordingly, we do not provide you with information about how to opt-out of sale of your Personal Information. If this policy changes, we will notify you and provide you with information about how to opt out of sale of your personal data by us.</em></strong></li>
<li>You have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment from us for exercising any of your privacy rights. That is, we cannot treat you differently for exercising any of these rights unless we demonstrate that the value of the Personal Information that you provide to us is reasonably relate to the difference in price or service that we offer.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on CCPA and how you can exercise your consumer privacy rights can be found here:&nbsp;<strong><u>https://filescience.io/ccpa</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following table lists categories of Personal Information that generally match the categories in the definition of Personal Information in CCPA. We indicate for each listed category the specific types of Personal Information in the category that we have collected within the past 12 months and why we collect it. We provide information about how we use and disclose Personal Information above in our Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>We keep your personal data only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law.
